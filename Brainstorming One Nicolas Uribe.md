**Laura's Favorite Apps:**
1. Discord
    A communication app that allows groups or individuals to talk with each other. I like that it allows easy conversation without needing phone numbers. I don't like that it can only be used with internet.
2. One Note
    A note-taking app that includes features to easily take notes. I like that it includes screenshot & other photo options, and text items. I don't like that it doesn't have an easy drawing feature.
3. Photos
    An app to access all the photos you have taken. I like that it organizes photos into albums and you can view them all at once or in certain situations. I don't like that you cannot search for photos.

**Marco's Favorite Apps:**
1. Instagram: 
- A great social app where you can share photos and videos with Friends and Family, as well as contact them and others from all over the world via Video Calls, Direct Messaging, and adding Friends. The best part is that you can contact Friends and share photos from anywhere around the world.
2. Fitness: 
- A solid app that allows user to track their steps, calories, and progress to help lose weight and maintain health. Great part is how it keeps you on top of your health and fitness goals.
3. Clock: 
- A great app that helps you keep track of time, setup alarms, and have timed schdules to help you with your routines. I use the alarm especially every day to help me wake up nice and early!
